# PCC_HS_UI_project.

This is a project for a simple blog post

## Instructions to set up project
1. Open terminal from VScode inside your project folder (Click View -> Terminal)
2. Ensure you have nodeJS installed, You can type  `node --version` and `npm --version` in the terminal to make sure you have everything installed correctly, you should see output like the following (Version does not matter):
>node --version\
v22.4.1 \
npm --version \
10.8.1
3. Once you check for node installation, run the following (this will install all dependant libraries for the backend application):
> cd backend \
npm install
4. You can start the backend of the application by running `npm run start`. If it starts successfully you will see something like this: `Server is Successfully Running, and App is listening on port 3001`
5. Open another terminal from VScode-- there will be a small + (plus) on the top right of the existing terminal which will open a new terminal
6. In the new terminal enter the following: 
> cd blog-metrics-app \
npm install
7. You can start the frontend  application by running `npm run start`. if it starts successfully you will see something like this: 
> Compiled successfully!\
\
You can now view blog-metrics-app in the browser.\
\
  Local:            http://localhost:3000        \
  On Your Network:  http://172.30.34.179:3000    \
  \
Note that the development build is not optimized.\
To create a production build, use npm run build. \
\
webpack compiled successfully
8. The app should open on your browser automatically. If it does not, you can navigate to the application by searching for `http://localhost:3000` on your browser
9. When you make changes to the UI (frontend), all you need to do is save the file and refresh the browser to view those changes. There is no need to restart the application.
